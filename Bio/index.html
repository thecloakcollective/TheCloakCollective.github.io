            Desirée Beduz is a costume creator and visual artist from a small town near Venice, Italy. 
            She started studying fashion at fourteen and graduated in Costume Design at eighteen, later 
            completing a post-graduate course in Fashion Styling in Verona. Those early years introduced 
            her to designers from different backgrounds and helped shape her way of building stories through 
            clothing. <br><br>

            Her first real step into the field came in 2015, when she worked in Sardinia 
            creating and adjusting costumes for performers in a touristic resort.
             After that summer, she continued freelancing for nightlife events across 
             Italy, creating bold, handmade pieces and learning how to work quickly, 
             creatively, and independently. <br><br>


            Between 2017 and 2018 she lived in the United States to improve her English before returning to 
            Italy for a short period. Soon after, she felt ready for a bigger move and relocated to Toronto in 2020. 
            Starting over during a pandemic wasn't easy, but it pushed her to adapt, stay focused, and build her path again 
            from the ground up. <br><br>

            By 2022, she returned fully to costume work and founded<strong> The Cloak Collective</strong>, her personal label dedicated to 
            handcrafted costumes, original designs, and experimental builds. Since then, she has designed for performers, 
            events, and festivals, and in 2025 she presented The Golden Hive: a 10-look collection at Fashion Art Toronto. <br><br>

            Today, Desirée brings together technical skill, material experimentation, and a strong visual sensibility to create pieces 
            that hold movement, emotion, and story. Her work continues to grow through new collaborations, custom builds, and personal 
            projects that explore what costume can express beyond the surface.

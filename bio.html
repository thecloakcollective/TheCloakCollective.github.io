            Desirée was born and raised in a small town near Venice, Italy. She
            started studying fashion at the age of 14, and graduated with a
            major in Costume Design when she was 18. She then pursued her
            studies in Verona where she got a qualification in Fashion Styling.
            This course gave her the opportunity to develop alongside upcoming
            Designers from all over the world. <br /><br />

            Her first real experience as a Costume Designer happened in 2015 at
            a resort in Sardinia where she was creating, fitting and remodeling
            costumes for the actors. Always following her passion, Desirée
            started freelancing making costumes for the Italian nightlife.
            <br />
            <br />

            Wanting to learn English, she moved to the United States between
            2017 and 2018 where she attended college classes. After flying back
            to Italy and spending a couple of years in her hometown, she felt
            that her career was supposed to continue overseas. Consequently, she
            applied for a Canadian working holiday visa in 2019. In 2020, it was
            approved and she flew to Toronto. <br /><br />

            Restarting from scratch was a big challenge, but it only took her a
            couple of years to get back into her Costume Design business. In
            2022, she launched <i>The Cloak Collective.</i>

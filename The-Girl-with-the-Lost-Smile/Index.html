            <h1>The Girl with the Lost Smile â€” Verona</h1>

            <p>Everyone loved Mrs. White. A woman with a charm like few others who lived a modest life. But there was something that tormented her. In some ways she often felt oppressed and judged by her husband. Even though she had everything she wanted, she felt obliged to free herself from this burden, she wanted to escape from the monotony to start a new life away from everything and everyone.</p>
